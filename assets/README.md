# Assets Directory

This directory contains the extension icons.

## Required Icons

You need to create the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons should represent the Manga Narrator extension (e.g., a book with a speaker icon).

You can create these icons using any image editor or icon generator tool.

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you create proper icons, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders.
